ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Thanks for checking out my website. I'm Andrew. This is my personal website to share my thoughts, opinions, and research on things I find interesting. Here you'll learn a little more about who I am as a person and what I'm interested in. As I collect my thoughts, I'll keep them organized by general categories for simplicity's sake. I hope you enjoy your time here!
