## Why A Personal Website

One of the big motivators for creating a personal website was wanting to improve the transfer of my critical thoughts to concrete ideas in the form of text. In essence, I figure that the more time I dedicate to writing and explaining my thoughts and ideas, the better I can articulate them to others. Then, it should be easier to have better discussions about said ideas, which in turn should lead to better flushed out ideas for everyone.

## Why .life as the suffix?

.life seemed to be a good representation of everything the site embodies. Whether I'm exploring life itself within some of the bigger questions we have about human experience, experiencing life through learning, improving life through coding & business ventures, or looking for life beyond our conceptual definition of it in space, the .life URL suffix embraces all themes of my website and ties it together in one neat bow.

## Why a tree as favicon?

When I was searching for the best icon to descibe the site I wanted a symbol that was representative of the sites contents. A tree fits for many reasons. The first is that a tree is a beautiful representation of life, which is a major theme of my website. The second is that trees commonly have mythological meaning, such as the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge. Such symbolism is again, a significant theme of my website.
